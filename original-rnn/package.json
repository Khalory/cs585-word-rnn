  "description": "This code implements **multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network** (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models. In other words the model takes one text file as input and trains a Recurrent Neural Network that learns to predict the next character in a sequence. The RNN can then be used to genrate text character by character that will look like the original training data. The context of this code base is described in detail in my [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).",
